# animation_art- 

- Since learning to code I have have had a huge itch to transform this into a digital web version. 
Enhancing it with animation and creaitng it more into a journey through the animation for the user etc..
The intersection of technology and art, The traditional and non-traditional.The past and the present.

- I created a personal storybook of myself at the end of my Fine Arts - Honours year which has emphasise on the process of my thinking.
